{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns, PatternGuards, ViewPatterns, OverloadedStrings #-}
-- | This module provides a simple import and export format for Awelon
-- dictionaries, emitting an entire dictionary as a large file. This
-- uses the following format:
--
--   @dup r^zlwl
--   @dupd rw{%dup}wl
--   @swap rwrwzwlwl
--   @over {%dupd} {%swap}
--   @dup.doc "(Copyable x) â‡’ x -- x x
--   ~l
--
-- The character @ does not appear in ABC (except in an embedded text
-- or token) and is not ambiguous at the beginning of a line. Thus, no
-- escapes are needed.
--
-- There are two primary structural constraints. First, a well-defined word
-- is listed only after all of its dependencies. Second, a word is listed at
-- most once. If a word contains any dependencies that are not defined, then
-- that word is not well-defined (e.g. it's part of a cycle, or it uses an
-- undefined word).
--
-- This format is called 'AODict' and uses internet media type:
--
--    text\/vnd.org.awelon.aodict
--
-- It is also associated with the '.ao' file extension.
