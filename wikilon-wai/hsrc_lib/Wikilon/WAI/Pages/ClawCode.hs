    H.p $ "Due to the underlying bytecode, claw code is tacit concatenative.\n\

          \with blocks representing first-class functions. Claw offers a very\n\
          \Forth-like experience (modulo environment and effects; see below)."

          \parse a higher level claw structure from the generated AO code. This\n\
          \isn't guaranteed to be exactly the same (if you wrote `4 10 ratio`\n\
          \it shall parse back into `4/10`). But this behavior will be simple,\n\
          \predictable, transparent; and the resulting view is more accessible\n\
          \compared to raw AO code."

        H.li $ (H.strong "extensibility") <> ": if ratios were an extension,\

    H.p $ "Vectors, matrices, and monadic do-notation are viable extensions\n\
          \to claw code that might be explored in the near future. Structured\n\
          \editors could feasibly extend claw code with rich media: tables,\n\
          \colors and color-pickers, graphs, diagrams, canvases, sliders and\n\

    H.h2 "Claw Environments and Effects"

    H.p $ "A claw command is a short string of words and numbers.\n\
          \Words are given meaning based on an implicit AO dictionary. An AO\n\
          \dictionary is self-contained and every word is purely functional.\n\
          \Thus claw commands are purely functional.\n\
          \We apply each command to the environment. Hence, the basic effect\n\
          \is manipulation of state. After updates, we render the environment\n\
          \for the human user, or at least part of it. E.g. for a turtle graphics\n\
          \REPL, we might render the top few elements on a stack and a canvas\n\
          \modeled as values in the environment."
    let avm = href uriAVMDocs "AVM" 
    H.p $ "Real-world effects are integrated by leveraging shared-state concepts.\n\
          \Between atomic user commands, background agents observe or influence\n\
          \the environment value. An outbox of messages might be cleared and sent.\n\
          \A data model or tuple space might be updated. General purpose effects\n\
          \could leverage the " <> avm <> " concepts of messaging and capabilities.\n\
          \Effects modeled above shared state are inherently asynchronous. However,\n\
          \a model of promises and futures could feasibly regain the look and feel\n\
          \of synchronous APIs and commands for convenience."
    H.p $ "Ultimately, we need a stable structure for our `env` value such that our\n\
          \background agents and renderers can process it and integrate useful effects.\n\
          \The shape of `env` will depend on the features we need."

    H.h2 "Claw Namespaces"

    H.p $ "Claw introduces a simple namespace concept."

    H.ul $ do
        H.li "Every region of a claw stream has exactly one namespace."
        H.li "Set namespace via a token prefixed with hash, e.g. `#NS`."
        H.li "Namespace tokens expand into an annotations, `\\{&ns:NS}`"
        H.li "The empty string is the default namespace, e.g. token `#`."
        H.li "If set within block, namespace applies only within block."
        H.li "Namespace becomes prefix when expanding words to tokens."
        H.li "That includes words integer, ratio, etc. from expansions."

    H.p $ "The role of namespaces is to support multiple command environments\n\
          \from a single dictionary. Shared metaphors between environments may\n\
          \need to use the same word with slightly different implementations.\n\
          \Words must remain concise for efficient use by humans."

    H.p $ "Claw's namespace model has the advantages of being simple, transparent,\n\
          \unambiguous. There is no need to inspect a codebase to determine how\n\
          \words will bind. The main disadvantage is that common words, even those\n\
          \with exactly the same implementation, must be repeated (or redirected)\n\
          \for each namespace in the dictionary. Automation might mitigate this."
