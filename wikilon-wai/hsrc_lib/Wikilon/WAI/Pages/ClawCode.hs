          \Claw is intended for use with REPLs and command line shells, where efficient\n\
          \keyboard input is needed in small doses of one line or so. Under the hood, AO\n\

          \blocks, and escapes into Awelon Bytecode (ABC). Claw words refer to an AO\n\
          \dictionary. Most logic and data should be in the dictionary so users only\n\
          \need a few words and arguments on a command line.\n\

    H.p $ "Claw code is generally associated with a namespace, which determines\n\
          \the implicit prefix for all words. Words outside this namespace may\n\
          \be represented explicitly using the escaped expansion `\\{%word}`. Some\n\
          \editors may support switching namespaces for regions of code, but the\n\
          \normal case is to just use one namespace, add or redirect to words\n\
          \as needed, and let the dictionary swallow any redundancy.\n\

          \reliably parsed back into same Claw code that produces it. Thus, the\n\

          \so we know that we recorded two zeroes after the decimal point.\n\

          \factoring, pushing logic into the dictionary, is essential for comprehension,\n\

          \one line or small text area at a time expressing a stateâ†’state function. Effects\n\

          \the state between user commands. All effects are asynchronous. User commands must\n\
