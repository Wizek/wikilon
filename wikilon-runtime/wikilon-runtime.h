 *
 *	@section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  Wikilon is part of Awelon project, which explores a new model for
 *  software development, in which a living system is defined by a set
 *  of acyclic functions. Awelon project uses its own Awelon Bytecode
 *  (ABC). This bytecode is simple and purely functional, but doesn't
 *  perform well in a naive interpreter. To recover performance, many
 *  techniques must be utilized.
 * 
 *  - Accelerators. Common subprograms (sequences of bytecode) are
 *    recognized and handled as a single opcode internally. We can
 *    accelerate collections-oriented programming, common loops,
 *    matrix math, conditional behaviors, and data plumbing.
 *  
 *  - Linearity and Move Semantics. While ABC values are logically
 *    immutable, it is possible to mutate values in place when only
 *    one reference to the value exists. Wikilon runtime makes this
 *    the default behavior because it's a good fit for ABC semantics.
 *
 *  - Compilation. We can annotate that subprograms are compiled JIT
 *    or AOT. Compilers can translate ABC to a form more suitable for
 *    modern hardware (e.g. abstract register and stack machines) and
 *    eliminate runtime data plumbing. With LLVM, it is feasible to
 *    achieve competitive performance.
 *
 *  - Large value stowage. Databases, filesystems, graphs, documents,
 *    game worlds, and more can be modeled as large immutable values.
 *    Large values are accessible for optimization and abstraction. 
 *    The common requirement for impure data systems APIs and waiting
 *    for data is reduced. LMDB is used for the backing store.
 *
 *  - Parallelism. Modulo space requirements, pure computations behave
 *    independently of evaluation order. Divide and conquer tactics 
 *    are effective if we can divide into coarse-grained tasks. ABC
 *    easily supports par/seq parallelism. 
 * 
 *  Wikilon runtime shall support these techniques. Further, large
 *  value stowage comes with an integrated persistence model via LMDB.
 *  Wikilon state is represented using ABC values, which simplifies 
 *  potential reflection and development of software agents.
 *
 *  Effectful code can be modeled either purely, e.g. yielding with
 *  requests and a continuation, or impurely via token stops. Wikilon
 *  favors pure models as easier to simulate, test, and reuse.
 *
 *  Wikilon runtime is designed to provide very predictable performance,
 *  suitable for real-time systems if used carefully. Many features like
 *  JIT and parallelism are driven by annotations. The garbage collector
 *  has very predictable behavior, and only applies to limited nursery
 *  arenas to avoid and compact heap allocations.
 *
 *  @section usage_sec Usage
 *
 *  Create an environment. Create a context within that environment.
 *  Load some values into the context, possibly via the key-value
 *  database. Perform computations and analyze the results.
 * 
 *  @section notes_sec Notes
 *
 *  Portability: Wikilon runtime is written for use in Linux with GCC.
 *  It doesn't use much non-portable code, though. With a little work, 
 *  it should be easily adapted for other systems.
 *
 *  Floating Point Numbers: At the moment, there are no accelerators
 *  for floating point computations. I hope to eventually develop 
 *  accelerators for a simple set of floating point representations
 *  and operations that can be accelerated by hardware FPU. 
 *  
 *  Locking: The LMDB file is only safe for a single application,
 *  and only a single wikrt_env within that application. This is 
 *  guarded by a simple file lock via flock(2). 
 *
 *  Hot Backup: Currently not supported. I would like to maybe support
 *  this explicitly, eventually.

/** @brief Opaque structure for overall Wikilon environment.
 * 
 * An environment includes an LMDB instance for large value stowage and

 * has a pool of worker threads (one on each CPU by default) to support
 * par/seq parallelism.
 *

/** @brief Opaque structure representing substrate for computations.
 *
 * A wikrt_cx, a wikilon runtime context, represents both a space and
 * a single thread for computations. The space may be shared via fork
 * and move functions, but a wikrt_cx contains several unsynchronized
 * structures (local free lists, root sets, etc.) and must be used from
 * only one client thread at a time. (See `wikrt_cx_fork()` for use of
 * multiple external threads in one context.)
 *
 * Wikilon runtime uses a 32-bit region even on 64-bit machines. This
 * limits contexts to 4GB active data at a time, though use of stowage
 * and transactions enables access to more. (I figure that if 64-bit
 * becomes essential, it will be easy to develop a 64-bit variant of
 * this library.)
 */

/** @brief A value reference within a context. 
 *
 * Wikilon's value model is based on Awelon Bytecode. Basic values
 * include integers, products, unit, sums, and blocks. Special case
 * data includes sealed values, stowed values, pending computations,
 * and compact representations (e.g. arrays, texts, binaries are 
 * lists `Î¼L.((a*L)+b)` but with tight encodings).
 *
 * Wikilon runtime assumes linear value references. That is, a value
 * should be consumed exactly once after allocation. A value must be
 * explicitly copied to use it more than once. This does hinder error
 * recovery. OTOH, a lot of functions can be implemented without any
 * allocation.
 *
 * A wikrt_vref value is bound to the wikrt_cx in which it was created.
 * At this time, a wikrt_cx is limited to a small finite number of such
 * bindings - e.g. 30 items - beyond which WIKRT_CXFULL is returned for
 * further allocations. This forces clients to model a stack within the
 * context when building or processing large values. OTOH, it reduces 
 * root-set management overhead for the common case.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *
 * - wikrt_vref**: outputs, or input-outputs (i.e. leftover outputs)
 * - wikrt_vref*: input values consumed linearly, invalid after use
 * - wikrt_vref const*: input values for non-destructive peek or copy

 * We can also serialize with stowed resources, though this limits code
 * to round-tripping and requires careful design to ensure stowed data
 * is not GC'd. Stowed addresses include an HMAC to secure access to
