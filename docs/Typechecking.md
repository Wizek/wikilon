# Typechecking for Wikilon

Kyle Blake developed abcc, which does some typechecking based on an infinite terms model. 

Bidirectional Typechecking seems a very natural fit. 

Is there a good way to *name* types? Would it be better to name them via recognition? Or annotation? Or some representation of types that I can name/assert/validate?
