I'm pretty happy with the [network model](NetworkModel.md) developed so far. 

Of course, for AVMs to be useful, we must provide capabilities to bind real-world effects. Which services shall be built into Wikilon?

* an equivalent of XMLHttpRequest
* support for web sockets
* support for publishing web apps
* publication of service registries
 * publish-subscribe
 * tuple spaces
