I'd like to begin developing some visually entertaining web apps from early on.

Logo language like turtle graphics is one promising option! 

And this can perhaps generalize to a PostScript.

Also: Haskell's 'Diagrams', SVG, Conal Elliott's 'Tangible Functional Programming', etc. seem viable.

Voxel-based system (3D turtle graphics?) might also be interesting.
