Holes
=====

Wikilon might help with development if developers create 'holes' or gaps that can be filled automatically. Usefully, holes can easily be modeled as words, or at a finer granularity of definition structure and DSL-specific content - e.g. treat words with incomplete (but not yet inconsistent) definitions as holes. An incomplete definition might be understood as operating on void, thus creating 'gaps' in structure or value that could be filled.
