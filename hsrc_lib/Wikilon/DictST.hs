-- | The Awelon Object (AO) dictionary is a primary data structure
-- of Wikilon. AO words form functions, modules, tests, documentation,
-- directives, web-applications, and wiki pages. But, essentially, the
-- content of each word is just some AO code, which ideally compiles,
-- is well typed, and passes all tests. 
--
-- This module describes the dictionary state.
--
-- In addition to a set of words, a dictionary tracks some useful
-- metadata about when changes were made, potentially who made them
-- and for which projects, etc.

-- | The DictST represents the current state of a dictionary, and it

--   a map from words to definitions

--
-- In addition, it enforces a weak validity property: that words are
-- well defined and acyclic. There is no assurance that words will
-- typecheck or that tests will pass. But they'll at least compile
-- to Awelon bytecode.
--
-- Updates to the DictST are performed by DictTX.

-- | Renaming Notes:
--
-- It's important to apply renames atomically, because our rename map
-- may contain cycles like [(foo,bar),(bar,baz),(baz,foo)]. This can
-- arise even from single rename actions; see mergeRenameMaps.
-- 
-- The main restrictions on renaming:
-- 
-- 1) we will only rename words that are in the dictionary
-- 2) we must reject 'collisions' where a word has two defs
--  (a) rename many words to the same target; (foo,baz),(bar,baz)
--  (b) target word exists in dictionary AND is not itself renamed
--
-- Feasibly, I could accept renames where the definitions match, e.g.
-- if `foo` and `bar` have the same definition, then renaming fooâ†’bar
-- wouldn't cause any change in observable behavior. However, I think
-- it would be better to treat this 'merge' explicitly, via update. I
-- will reject even such benign collisions.

-- | applyRN' - apply rename map ASSUMING it is valid 
--
-- Two steps: content before index.
--
-- Content Rename, e.g. renaming 'foo'
--   Compute a set of words whose definitions must be rewritten.
--     E.g. if 'foo' is directly used by 'qux' (via RLU), then update qux. 
--   Compute a set of words whose reverse-lookups must be rewritten.
--     E.g. if 'foo' is defined as 'bar baz', then rewrite RLU for bar & baz
--   Apply renames to body elements in both sets.
--
-- Index Rename:
--   Remove all renamed elements into separate list.
--   Apply rename function to key elements of list.
--   Insert the list back into the index.
--
-- I'm not 100% confident in this design, so it might be worth 
-- validating if bugs are found in renaming.

--
-- In case of a rename cyle like (foo,bar),(bar,baz),(baz,foo), we
-- separate removing keys [foo,bar,baz] from adding the newer
-- names [bar,baz,foo]. Some renames are potentially neutral on

--
-- Performance of the current implementation is O(R*lgN) where R is
-- the number of renamed elements and N is the dictionary size. R is
