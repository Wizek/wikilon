-- | This module provides a simple import and export format for Awelon
-- dictionaries, emitting an entire dictionary as a large file. This
-- uses the following format:
--
--   @dup [r^zlwl][]
--   @dupd [rw{%dup}wl][]
--   @swap [rwrwzwlwl][]
--   @over [{%dupd} {%swap}][]
--   @dup.doc "(Copyable x) â‡’ x -- x x
--    ~[v'c]
--
-- Besides defining each word starting at a newline and escape rules
-- for LF (escape by following SP), this format is expected to ensure
-- that all dependencies for any given word are defined before that
-- word, and that every word is defined exactly once. This guards two
-- invariants for dictionaries: acyclic and fully defined.
